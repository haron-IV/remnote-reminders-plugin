## ✨ Features

- #️⃣ **Add a Single Reminder** — Create a reminder for any Rem with one click.
- 🧩 **Add Multiple Reminders** — Select multiple lines and add reminders for each one at once.
- 🔗 **Direct Links** — Every reminder message you receive contains a **direct link** to the specific Rem inside your RemNote.

## 🔐 Privacy First

Your data is safe:

- Reminders are stored on our server **only as long as the Rem has the "remind me" powerup** in RemNote.
- When you remove the "remind me" tag from a Rem, the reminder **is instantly deleted** from the server.

You are always in full control over your data.
